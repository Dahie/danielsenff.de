h2. Description

This plugin offers a node-based graphical user interface for image editing in ImageJ. It allows to create macros by connecting processing nodes to form a workflow, which represents the way macro-commands are called by ImageJ. These workflows can be saved and loaded.

A Workflow consists of Sources, which load or create images. They will be connected to other processing units and describe the processing that will be performed. A workflow requires at least one node to be defined as a display. The result of this unit will be opened after running the workflow.

ImageFlow is also available as a stand-alone program that uses ImageJ as a library.

ImageFlow works on all platforms, Java 5.0 or later must be installed.

A large number of unit-elements for building graphs are included, however additional units can be created and added. Documentation on how to create own units is included and can be used. I can incorporate more units in later releases. Feedback of any kind is well appreciated.

h2. Installation

ImageFlow can be started as a stand-alone application or as a plugin for ImageJ.

h3. … as stand-alone

To start ImageFlow from ImageJ you have to move "Imageflow"-folder into ImageJ's plugin directory. After restarting ImageJ you will find a menu-item in the Plugins-Menu to start the plugin.
