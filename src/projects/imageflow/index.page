h2. Beschreibung

<p>This plugin offers a node-based graphical user interface for Macro-creation and image editing. 
It allows to create macros by connecting nodes to form a workflow, which represents the way 
macro-commands are called by ImageJ. These workflows can be saved and loaded. </p>
<p>A workflow consists of Sources, which load or create images. They will be connected to
other units to define the order of processing. A workflow requires at least one
node to be defined as a display. The result of this unit will be opened after running the workflow.</p>
<p>ImageFlow is also available as a stand-alone program that uses ImageJ as a library. 
To run it, download and extract the archive 
<a href="imageflow-11.zip" title="Download">Imageflow.zip</a> and double click on 
the ImageFlow_.jar. <br/>Works on all platforms, Java 5.0 or later must be installed.</p>

<p>A number of unit-elements for building graphs are included, however the list is not 
very long yet. Documentation on how to create own units is included and can be used. 
I can incorporate more units in later releases. <br />
Feedback of any kind is well appreciated.</p>
